### Architecture
<image src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="300"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above shows the high-level design of PlanITarium.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact.

**Main components of the Architecture**

[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/planitarium/PlanITarium.java) 
is responsible for,
* At launch, initialize the components in an appropriate manner and calls Storage to read data if any. 
* Read user's commands from standard input for command execution.
* At shut down, invokes shutdown sequence and calls Storage to save its current data. 

[`UI`](#UI-Component) is responsible for the UI of PlanITarium.

[`Commands`](#Commands-Component) is responsible for the execution of commands.

[`Parser`](#Parser-Component) is responsible for parsing and validating user input.

[`Persons`](#Persons-Component) is responsible for holding the user data of PlanITarium in memory.

[`Money`](#Money-Component) is responsible for holding the monetary information in memory.

[`Storage`](#Storage-Component) is responsible for reading and writing data to the hard disk.

**How the components interact with each other**

{referring to AB-3, describe one encompassing command such as `add /n Alice`}

#### \[Proposed] Logical grouping for different generation of person added

##### Proposed implementation

The proposed logical grouping of persons added is facilitated by `Family`. It holds 3 lists of `PersonList`, each one
for a different generation. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `Family#list()` -- Lists a high level overview of income and expenditure of each generation.
* `Family#remain()` -- Prints the total disposable income remaining for the family after everybody's income and   
expenditures have been taken into account.
* `Family#addParent()` -- Adds a person into the `parents` list.
* `Family#addMyGen()` -- Adds a person into the `myGen` list.
* `Family#addChild()` -- Adds a person into the `children` list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how a generation's high level finance overview is calculated.

Step 1. The user launches the application. A `Family` object will be initialised with its 3 generational   
`PersonList`s. They are `parents`, `myGen`, and `children`.
-- Insert UML object diagram here

Step 2. The user wishes to add a person, say `John Doe`, to the `children` list. The user executes   
`add /n John Doe /g 3` command, adding a `Person` with `name` as `John Doe` to group 3, which is the `children`.
-- Insert UML object diagram here


Step 3. The user executes `addin /g 3 /u 1 /i ...` to add a new income to index 1 of the `children` list, who is   
`John Doe`. This causes an income object to be added to the `IncomeList` of `John Doe`.
-- Insert UML object diagram here

Step 4. The user now decides to have an overview of his family's finances by executing the `list` command. The `list`  
command will call `Family#list()`, which will go through each generation to sum up their incomes and expenditures and  
print that out.
-- Insert UML sequence diagram here

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How to sort persons into logical groups:**
* **Alternative 1 \(current choice):** Have a `Family` object hold 3 `PersonList`s, one for each generation.
    * Pros: Only requires storage of one instance of each income and expenditure.
    * Cons: May have performance issues related to operations which work on every income and expenditure as it makes  
  them deeply nested.
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain the single `PersonList` with everyone inside, but give a tag to each `Person` to  
indicate which generation they belong to
    * Pros: Very low maintenance and changes required to existing code.
    * Cons: Lack of abstraction, and that total income and expenditure for each generation would need to be   
  stored until the entire list is iterated through before being able to print.



### Money Component
{For Jiarong}

### Storage Component
**API: **

The `Storage` component,

* can save each person's data and their income and expenditure data when the program exits into a local file, and reads 
  them back into corresponding objects when the program runs again.
* depends on the classes in the `Person` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  to the `Person`)

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Command Execution

Maybe for Huilin
{Suggest to show the process from `user input` to `input parsing` to `command factory`
then actual execution}

### Add Grouped User Feature

Maybe for Weijun
{Suggest to show the process to `add a new Person` to a logical group i.e. Children}

### Edit Values Feature 

Maybe for Jiarong
{Suggest to show the process from `parsing several delimiters` to `finding the
income/expenditure` to `editing the value`.}

### [Proposed] Listing Categorised Expenditures Feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed listing categorised expenditure feature is facilitated by `Categories`,
`Money(temp)`, `MoneyList(temp)`  and `Family`. The `Categories` is an enumeration of keys
that is used as the expenditure categories. The `Money(temp)` will have an additional integer 
attribute that acts as an index to a category. Additionally, the following operations are 
implemented:

* `Categories#getLabel(index)` -- Returns the name of the category with this index. 
* `Money(temp)#getCategory()` -- Returns the category index for this expense.
* `MoneyList(temp)#getExpenseOfCategory(index)` -- Returns a list of expenditures having 
category index matching the index argument.
* `Family#listExpenseOfCategory(index)` -- Lists all expenses from the category index.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the expenses of a category will be printed.

Step 1. Given that the application already has existing data and there are two people being tracked,
Alice and Bob, and only Alice's expenses were added and categorised. Suppose that Alice is the main
user and Bob is her father, then Alice would belong to the current generation and Bob would belong
to the parent generation. In this case `Family` would be initialised with two generations being
tracked - parents and myGen.

<image src="images/ListCategorisedExpense0.png"/>

Step 2. The user executes `listc /c 1` command to list all expenses in category `1`. The `listcat`
command will be parsed and calls `Family#listExpenseOfCategory(1)` which would instantiate a
temporary array list for storing the results of the upcoming search.

<image src="images/ListCategorisedExpense1.png"/>

Step 3. After the temporary array list has been created, the generations being tracked will be
iterated for `Person` objects. The `expenditureList` for a person would be retrieved during that
person's iteration and `MoneyList(temp)#getExpenseOfCategory(1)` will be called as `expenditureList`
extends `MoneyList(temp)`. This method then iterates through the list and calls
`Money(temp)#getCategory()` on each expenditure, collecting and returning the expenditure if its
category matches the given index. The returned expenditures are then appended to the temporary
array list.

<image src="images/ListCategorisedExpense2.png"/>

Step 4. The iteration, collecting and appending to the temporary array list in step 3 is repeated 
until every person has been iterated. Finally, `Categories#getLabel(1)` is called so that an
appropriate message can be displayed to the user, stating the name of the category, following by
a series of print to display the expenditures in this category.

> :information_source: **Note:** If the `index` provided does not map to any existing categories,
> then it can be observed that there will never be any results returned. The `listcat` command will
> check the index provided using `Parser#checkValidCategory` before iterating `Family`. If the check
> fails, an error message will be displayed to the user instead of continuing with the execution.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `listcat` operation works after the `ListCatCommand` has
been created by [`CommandFactory`](#PlaceholderToCommandFactory):
<image src="images/ListCategorisedExpenseSequence.png"/>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to categorise expenses to be listed:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Adding a category attribute to expenses.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and less memory usage.
  * Cons: May have performance issues as it needs to iterate through every person's expenditure.
  
* **Altertive 2:** Maintain an array list for each category and store a copy of expenses.
  * Pros: Fast to print expenses in a category, no unnecessary look-ups.
  * Cons: Poor memory management, needs to store twice as many expenditures. 

### Data Archiving

#### \[Proposed]Saving and loading feature

##### Proposed implementation

The proposed saving and loading mechanism is facilitated by `Storage`. It loads records of `PersonList` for each logical 
grouping inside family from a local file, process the data and adds the record to `Family` for the current session. 
Saves the `PersonList` record of each `Family` grouping back into the local file upon exit of the program. It implements 
the following operations:

* `Storage#checkFileExists()` -- Checks if `PlanITarium.txt` file exists in the local hard drive, creates one if it 
  does not.
* `Storage#saveData()` -- Writes `PersonList` record of each `Family` grouping into `PlanITarium.txt` file upon exit 
  of the program.
* `Storage#loadData()` -- Opens and reads `PlanITarium.txt` for any existing `PersonList` records and updates the
  `PersonList` data in the current session for each logical group in `Family`.

Given below is an example scenario and how the save and load mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. A `Storage` object will be initialised with an empty `PersonList` for each
`Family` grouping. The following sequence diagram shows how the `Storage` object is initialised

Step 2. The program will create a new `PersonList` for the session which calls `Storage#loadData()`, causing a check if 
the local file `PlanITarium.txt` exists by calling `Storage#checkFileExists()` and creates one if it does not. The data 
in the local file will be read, parsed and added to the empty `PersonList` in `Storage` by calling `PersonList` adding 
operations. The data in the `PersonList` will then be returned to `PersonList` for each `Family` grouping
in the current session. The following sequence diagram shows how the loading operation works:
<img src="images/StorageLoadSequence.png"/>


Step 3. The user then decides to exit the program by executing the command `bye`, `Storage#saveData` will be called.
All data in the `Family` object will be written to the local file `PlanITarium.txt` in the format of
`<group type> <user/operation> <Category> <Details>` which are to be read again when the program starts up. 
The following Sequence diagram shows how the saving operation will work:
<img src="images/StorageSaveSequence.png"/>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: When saving of data is executed:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saving occurs just before the program exits.
  * Pros: Better performance as it only needs to iterate through every person's data once
  * Cons: Data will not be saved if the program crashes or exits unintentionally.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the current data of each Person after every addition, deletion or update operation.
  * Pros: The local file will constantly be updated and lowers the risk of losing records
  * Cons: May have performance issue as it needs to iterate through every person's data to be saved after each 
    operation.
